## 0.1.0 2020-03-30

This is based on dry-system-rails that dry-rails replaces.

### Added

- `config.features` setting which is an array with feature identifiers that you want the railtie to boot (@solnic)
- `:application_contract` feature which defines `ApplicationContract` within the application namespace and configured to work with `I18n` (@solnic)
- `:safe_params` feature which extends `ApplicationController` with `schema` DSL and exposes `safe_params` controller helper (@solnic)
- `:controller_helpers` feature which adds `ApplicationController#{resolve,container}` shortcuts (@solnic)
